{"name":"Color Picker","tagline":"An open-source iOS color picker with quick-select, hue-grid and HSL wheel. You can also define transparency and save favorite colors.","body":"Color Picker\r\n====================\r\n\r\nBackground\r\n----------\r\n\r\nA color picker is the most conspicuously absent component in the collection of built-in controls provided by Apple in the iOS library. There are many open-source components that have sprung up to fill the gap. This component was created for the [ToonThat][https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/toonthat/id584478951?ls=1&mt=8] application as we didn't find the level of flexibility and feature-set in the others.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n-------\r\n<table cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"0\" width=\"100%\" style=\"border:0px;\">\r\n<tr>\r\n        <td style=\"border:0px;\"><img width=\"256\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://github.com/neovera/colorpicker/blob/master/etc/image1.png?raw=true\"></td>\r\n        <td style=\"border:0px;\"><img width=\"256\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://github.com/neovera/colorpicker/blob/master/etc/image2.png?raw=true\"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n        <td style=\"border:0px;\"><img width=\"256\" height=\"384\" src=\"https://github.com/neovera/colorpicker/blob/master/etc/image3.png?raw=true\"></td>\r\n        <td style=\"border:0px;\"></td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</table>\r\n\r\nFeatures\r\n-------\r\n* Shows a simple color pallete (simplifies the simple case).\r\n* iPhone 5 ready - color pallete expands to fill larger screen.\r\n* Hue grid - more variations of primary color. Color line in the bottom can be tapped to select color or grid can be swiped left and right.\r\n* HSL selector - for fine grain color selection, presents Hue circle and separate saturation and luminosity controls.\r\n* Alpha selector\r\n* Allows users to save their favorite colors. Favorites are stored in a file in the Documents directory.\r\n* Simple delegate model.\r\n* You can specify current color selection and title for header.\r\n\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\nIn your view controller where you want to invoke the color picker, first implement the methods of the delegate:\r\n\r\n    @implementation MyViewController <NEOColorPickerViewControllerDelegate>\r\n    \r\nAssuming you want to launch the view controller in response to a button being clicked, setup and launch an instance of NEOColorPickerViewController:\r\n\r\n    NEOColorPickerViewController *controller = [[NEOColorPickerViewController alloc] init];\r\n    controller.delegate = self;\r\n    controller.currentColor = <some initial color reference>;\r\n    controller.dialogTitle = @\"My dialog title\";\r\n    \r\n    [self presentViewController:controller animated:YES completion:nil];\r\n    \r\nFinally handle the color picker delegate callback when the color is selected. You can also implement an optional callback that is called when the color picker is dismissed:\r\n\r\n    - (void) colorPickerViewController:(NEOColorPickerBaseViewController *)controller didSelectColor:(UIColor *)color {\r\n        // Do something with the color.    \r\n        self.view.backgroundColor = color;\r\n        [controller dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES completion:nil];\r\n    }\r\n\r\nLicense \r\n------\r\n[Apache License 2.0](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html)\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
